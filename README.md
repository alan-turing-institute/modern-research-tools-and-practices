# Modern Research Tools and Practices

## What are these sessions?

These sessions are informal discussions focused on modern research tools and practices. 
The goal is to have members of the Turing community share some software tool (ideally open-source) or practice they *use* or are *currently learning*.
In the former case, this can help others in the community learn a new tool or practice.
In the latter case, it can promote a more open approach to collaborative learning.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Presentations should be informal** 
>
> No slides are required for these sessions, but they can be used if the presenter wishes.
> Instead, the preference would be to have the presenter demo the tool, workflow, or practice they are currently using or exploring.
> The ideal setup is an informal, screen sharing-based presentation—imagine the group are shadowing you as you work.

### Pre-requisites

Sessions should be accessible to all members of the Turing community.
This is, obviously, a tricky balance to get right.
What it does exclude, for instance, is assuming that everyone who attends is a data scientist or software engineer.

Rather, these presentations should complement similar sessions such as the REG talks or the Institute's lunch and learn talks.
If there is sufficient interest in a particular topic, and need for a "deeper dive", we can always arrange follow-ups using these existing sessions.
